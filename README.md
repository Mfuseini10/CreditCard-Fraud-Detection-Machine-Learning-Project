## Building a Fraud Detection Model 
### Introduction
Credit card fraud involves the illegal use of someone else's credentials to make fraudulent credit card transactions so that the individual is charged for items that they did not purchase. The person whose credit card is mishandled usually ends up with unpaid debt. He/she may be unable to obtain new credit due to a poor credit score (at least until matters are sorted out), which makes early detection of fraudulent transactions by credit card companies crucial.

It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase. Eventually, it is also important for companies NOT to detect transactions which are genuine as fraudulent, otherwise, companies would keep blocking the credit card, and which may lead to customer dissatisfaction.
